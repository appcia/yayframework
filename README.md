# YayFramework #

## Introduction ##

YayFramework is a little php framework. It attempts to provide a solid
and easily understandable API for common php programming tasks, like database handling, caching, managing files
and more. I wrote it for myself, but it's always good to share your code with others. Someday someone may find
this project useful.

YayFramework is in a realy early stage, it's not capable of being used in a production environment.
